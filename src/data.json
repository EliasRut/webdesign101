			"Most of the Mercer's armament appears to be geared at fighting AeroSpace Fighters and other DropShips. The Pulse Lasers and LRM's with Artemis IV fire control systems improve the odds of hitting fast moving targets, while the Streak SRM-6 launchers won't fire until they have a target lock. For long range direct fire support, the Mercers mount a large array of Extended Range PPCs and Extended Range Large Lasers. Firing into every arc, these weapons can damage opponents regardless of distance. To provide additional firepower, the nose mounts a pair of Gauss Rifles. These long-range, low heat weapons will inflict serious damage on any DropShip or AeroSpace fighter foolish enough to get in their path.",

These weapons typically allow for a higher hit probability against fast moving targets like AeroSpace Fighters. Though they may be an \"inelegant\" weapon, the Clans traditional disdain for using DropShips in combat would seem to negate that problem."
